Your submit script should also contain resource allocation parameters.
Namely, —nodes and —ntasks-per-node.
Since you have not specified nodes, it reserves 1 for the job, which is enough for 1,2 and 4 cores, but not for 64 cores.
The maximum no. of cores on a single node here is 24.
That’s why your job was rejected for 64 cores.
The code would work for following directives:

--nodes=4

--ntasks-per-node=16
